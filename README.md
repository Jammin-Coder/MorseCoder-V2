# MorseCoder-V2
###$ Only works on systems like Ubuntu which have `paplay` installed.
Brand new morse coder with a twist.

To use the program:
```
python main.py "sos"
```
The progam then beeps out the morse code along with this output:
```
... --- ...
```
Only accepts morse code at the moment. I want it to take in plain text and beep out its corresponding morse code in the future.
